# PhpStorm IDE Settings
My personal settings for phpstorm.  
- live template settings include short cuts for auto generating react components & various react code templates.  

### Important - In order to use these settings, you have to also be using the JetBrains IDE suite (PHPStorm, Webstorm, etc). 
To import, see:  https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/exporting-and-importing-settings.html
